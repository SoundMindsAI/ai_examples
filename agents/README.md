## Summary
In this beginners friendly lecture, we will build AI agents with llama3.3 and PhiData framework. We will build a finance agent that will compare two stocks in terms of analyst recommendations and company fundamentals. Then we will build a team of agents where the first agent will be a web search agent. The second one will be a finance agent and a team lead agent will coordinate with these two agents to accomplish certain tasks.
